For Representatives: REPRESENTATIVE NAME must publicly call for a ceasefire, pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and vote NO on sending more weapons for this war. A “humanitarian pause” is not good enough. They should cosponsor the ceasefire resolution, House Resolution 786, introduced by Representatives Cori Bush and Rashida Tlaib. %0D%0A %0D%0A

For Senators: SENATOR NAME must publicly call for a ceasefire, pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and vote NO on sending more weapons for this war. A “humanitarian pause” is not good enough. They should introduce a Senate Resolution calling for a ceasefire, similar to the one in the House. %0D%0A %0D%0A

I am passionate about this because…

I have family/friends in the region and…
I visited Palestine and witnessed firsthand how
My faith compels me to…
While I am speaking as an individual…

%0D%0A
%0D%0A
I talked to my neighbors about this and we all agree that…
I am a member of … and we all agree that…
%0D%0A
Most U.S. voters agree that the U.S. should push for a ceasefire.
